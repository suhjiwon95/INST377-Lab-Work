# SunriseSunset by Jiwon Suh
## This project was built for a final roject of INST 377 course.
## here is the Github Page for the project: [Go to Gitbub page](https://suhjiwon95.github.io/INST377-Lab-Work/client/final_project/)

### This is built for desktop users with the latest version of browsers.

### This website displays the sunrise and sunset times for user's current location. I used [sunrise-sunset.org's API](https://sunrise-sunset.org/) to get the times and Geolocation API to get the current location of users.

### I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the most part. For the visualization, I used p5.js library.
